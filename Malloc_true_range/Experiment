This experiment is there to test the true range we can explore
on a pointer returned by the system's malloc both forward and backward.

On OSX, I observed different range for reading and writing.

On my machine, with Linux, both are equal to 134496 bytes when reading forward.
When reading backward, both are equal to 673 bytes.
